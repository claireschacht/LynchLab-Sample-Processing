#### A.	Introduction to Sample Intake or "Check-in"
For any sample intake done in the Lynch Lab, you will need to follow these guidelines:
* Whoever receives the shipment from the carrier service is responsible for the intake of those samples (unless determined otherwise).
* Unpack the box by keeping samples on dry ice and double-check that all vials match the manifest included in shipment -- ensure no damage.
* Complete intake with eLabJournal and Lynch Lab Airtable. Instructions listed below in 1c and 3c.
* Transfer samples into new freezer storage box and create a box label with the Dymo Printer. Ex) Project Name, Sample Type, Date, Initials.
* Store in designated project rack within -80 freezer (can be located on eLabJournal).

### 1.	Airtable:
#### a.	Description and Intro 
Airtable is used for a variety of tasks to keep track of projects, protocols, and sample check-in/check-out. 

Navigate to the Lynch Lab Airtable by logging in with the lab login credentials supplied in the Lab Etiquette Document. You will see a variety of bases that are accessible depending on your needs. The most common bases used will be Lynch Lab Airtable, Lynch Lab Microbial Strain Collection, Lab Meeting Schedule, and Protocols. 
The Lynch Lab Airtable base is for projects, sample check-in/check-out (including eLabJournal), progress tracking, and any study relevant documents.

#### c.	Projects and Sample Intake:
To add a new project and samples to the Lynch Lab Airtable, you will need to follow the steps listed here:![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82829415/125141194-293f6180-e0c9-11eb-9929-333f34cbc3bc.png)
* 1.	** After intake with eLabJournal! ** 
* 2.	Navigate to Sample Check-in/Check-out tab and fill in the fields provided
* 3.	Navigate to Projects tab and add a new project by scrolling down to the last entry and then filling in a new row of fields according to the column name.
* 4.  Always add date samples are returned to collaborators by filling in "sample return date" and supplying any tracking information or email correspondence.

#### d. Progress Tracker and Results
Progress Tracker and Rrsults tabs are used to view the current step of each project and samples. To make a new entry in Progress Tracker:
*	Enter info into fields (Processing ID, Project Name, Processed by, Date of Experiment, Processing Type, Current Step in Pipeline, Protocol log (link to Benchling experiment entry), Notes of changes, Mapping File, and Current Freezer Location)
* A new entry should be created with every new batch of samples processed* 
##### Keeping up-to-date:
* Update Current Step in Pipeline, add another additional links for Protocol Log, add Mapping file when necessary, and New Freezer Location when moved around from -80 to -20. 
* Results will automatically populate. This tab will mainly be used by Katie and Sue to view current project progress. 

### 2.	Benchling:
#### a.	Description and Intro 
Benchling is used as an electronic lab notebook. Here you will input your experiment recordings according to specific projects and steps within the pipeline

Lynch Lab Projects breaks into a variety of files for each project. You can navigate through the directories according to: the project, experiment type, and personal entries + Sample type.  Personal entries will house the specific electronic lab notebook for your experiments performed.

#### c.	Account Navigation
*	Login to Benchling with your personal credentials. An invitation will be send to you by the admin of our group. Once logged in you will be able to go through various projects and experiments. All personal experiments are on read-only for other lab members. Only you will have the ability to edit your own documents.

#### d.	Entries and Use 
 *	Navigate through Projects to specific Experiment type and Personal Entries/Sample Type. 
*	Create a new blank entry for yourself in the Personal Entries directory by clicking the plus sign on the upper left side of the page. Click on entry and then “Entry From Template”.
*	Select the correct template for your experiment type (example: 16s experiments)
*	Name the entry “Name, experiment type, sample type” (example: Claire gDNA extraction from Mother Stool)
*	Start inputting your protocol by uploading your protocol doc to “add protocol” tab
*	Fill in the “Notes” tab with your experiment notes and information necessary. It is very important to you keep the log of specific samples used by filling in the template’s fields. 
*	This can now only be edited by you but can be viewed by any user in our group.

### 3.	Elabjournal:
#### a.	Description and Intro 
ElabJoural is our sample intake and freezer inventory platform. Here you sample intake, print labels, and assign a permanent home for samples logged. It is the interface between Airtable and organization of samples.

#### c.	Sample intake
Prior to Sample Intake: 
Create an excel file containing separate columns for: Name, Description, Project, Specimen ID, Sample ID, intake date, and date of collection (if info is available on manifest). This will be used for the import process.
* Name should be the Sample ID number (if Sample ID and Specimen ID are the same, then use Specimen ID as name)
*	Description should be sample type
*	Project is the designated project name
*	Specimen ID is the Participant ID or whatever identifier given by collaborator. 
*	Intake date 
*	Date of Collection (if given by collaborator)

Sample Intake:
1. Navigate to “Sample List” and click “Import Samples”.
2. Enter number is samples to import, check the “Associate External Barcode” box, give the new samples a location within a freezer rack, and indicate the sample type. 
3. A new field will appear for you to select the desired fields for each sample for intake. Select: Name, Description, Project, Specimen ID, Sample ID, intake date, and date of collection (if info is available on manifest)
4. Click “Start Import”
5. Click “Paste from Clipboard” and paste sample information from excel sheet (with the correct order of column names). 
6. Click “Paste” and it will automatically fill each column for you, including all field you selected. Double check each field/column to verify accuracy.
7. Click “Import” and all of your samples will be cataloged in eLabJournal.  

#### d.	Printing Labels
If you need to print sample vial labels for any reason you will need to:
1.	Navigate to Sample List or the freezer location of your samples

3.	To add a rack or box to a specific freezer you will need to navigate to that Freezer # and the shelf desired
4.	Click the orange “+Add” button and select “add rack” or “add box”
5.	Input the info required and make sure to label by: Project, Sample Type, Experiment Step, Date, and your initials!!
