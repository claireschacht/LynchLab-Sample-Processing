#### A.	Introduction to Sample Intake
For any sample intake done in the Lynch Lab, you will need to follow these guidelines:
* Whoever receives the shipment is responsible for the intake of those samples (unless determined otherwise).
* Unpack the box by keeping samples on dry ice and double-check that all vials match the manifest included in shipment -- ensure no damage.
* Complete intake with eLabJournal and Lynch Lab Airtable. Instructions listed below in 1c and 3c.
* Transfer samples into new freezer storage box and create a box label. Ex) Project Name, Sample Type, Date, Initials.
* Store in designated project rack within -80 freezer (can be located on eLabJournal).

### 1.	Airtable:
#### a.	Description and Intro 
Airtable is used for a variety of tasks to keep track of projects, protocols, and sample intake. 

Navigate to the Lynch Lab Airtable by logging in with the universal login credentials supplied in the Lab Etiquette Document. You will see a variety of boxes that are accessible depending on your needs. The most common used will be Lynch Lab Airtable, Lynch Lab Microbial Strain Collection, Lab Meeting Schedule, and Protocols. 
The Lynch Lab Airtable box is for projects, sample intake (including eLabJournal), Progress Tracker, and Freezer Catalog (simplified version of eLabJournal for quick reference).

#### c.	Projects and Sample Intake:
To add a new Project and samples to the Lynch Lab Airtable, you will need to follow the steps listed here:![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82829415/125141194-293f6180-e0c9-11eb-9929-333f34cbc3bc.png)
* 1.	** After intake with eLabJournal! ** 
* 2.	Navigate to sample intake tab and fill in the fields provided
* 3.	Navigate to Projects tab and add a new project by scrolling down to the last entry and then filling in a new row of fields according to the column name.

#### d. Progress Tracker
Progress Tracker is used to view the current step of each project and samples. To make new entry:
*	Enter info into fields (Project, Date Started, Processed by, Samples Processed, Processing Type, Current Step in Pipeline, Protocol log (link to Benchling experiment entry) 
* A new entry should be created with every new batch of samples processed* 
##### Keeping up-to-date:
* Update Current Step in Pipeline, add another link for Protocol Log, add Mapping file when necessary,  and New Freezer Location when moved around from -80 to -20. 

### 2.	Benchling:
#### a.	Description and Intro 
Benchling is used as an electronic lab notebook. Here you will input your experiment recordings according to specific projects and steps within the pipeline

Lynch Lab Projects breaks into a variety of files for each project. You can navigate through the directories according to: the project, experiment type, and personal entries + Sample type.  Personal entries will house the specific electronic lab notebook for your experiments performed.

#### c.	Sample intake
Prior to Sample Intake: 
Create an excel file containing separate columns for: Name, Description, Project, Specimen ID, Sample ID, intake date, and date of collection (if info is available on manifest). This will be used for the import process.
* Name should be the Sample ID number (if Sample ID and Specimen ID are the same, then use Specimen ID as name)
*	Description should be sample type
*	Project is the designated project name
*	Specimen ID is the Participant ID or whatever identifier given by collaborator. 
*	Intake date 
*	Date of Collection (if given by collaborator)

4. Click “Start Import”
5. Click “Paste from Clipboard” and paste sample information from excel sheet (with the correct order of column names). 
6. Click “Paste” and it will automatically fill each column for you, including all field you selected. Double check each field/column to verify accuracy.
